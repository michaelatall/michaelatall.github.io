      <p><B>Bio:</B><p/>
      <p> I am an advantageous 16 year old girl from Morgan Hill, California. I am entering the 11th grade, and am currently attending Archbishop Mitty High School. As of now, I am living with my two older brothers, Matthew (22), Christopher (17), my dog Sonny, my mom, and my dad. As I am now a part of Girls Who Code, you can find me coding on the weekdays and hanging with my friends and or playing volleyball on the weekends.</p>

        <img id="hockey_id" src="hockey.jpg"></img>
        <p> From a young age I was introduced to an ongoing interest in sports whether watching or playing. Two of the biggest being volleyball and hockey.
        <p> I have been persuing volleyball for the past five years and am still playing today. As for hockey, I was exposed to the game at a young age due to my families ongoing passion and love for both watching and playing the sport. Currently, we go between rooting for the San Jose Sharks or the Boston Bruins.<div>

          <p> On my free time I enjoy watching movies whether by myself, with friends, or family. Some of my absolute favorites include romance and comedy.
